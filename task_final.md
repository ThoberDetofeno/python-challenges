# Technical Design Document: SupportWise AI Co-pilot

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical architecture for SupportWise's AI Co-pilot, an intelligent system that empowers non-technical users to extract actionable insights from Zendesk support data through natural language interactions. The solution balances real-time responsiveness with cost-effectiveness while ensuring data security and system scalability.

## Context and Scope

### Project Context
SupportWise Inc. requires an AI-powered solution to democratize access to customer support insights locked within Zendesk. The system must bridge the gap between complex data engineering requirements and business user needs, enabling natural language querying of millions of support tickets and comments.

### Scope Definition
**In Scope:**
- Natural language interface for querying Zendesk data
- Real-time and batch processing capabilities
- Data visualization generation
- Persistent query/report management
- Sentiment analysis and complex business insights
- Multi-year historical data analysis

**Out of Scope (MVP):**
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Real-time ticket streaming
- Integration with non-Zendesk data sources
- Mobile application
